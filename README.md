# RunePlot

# ⚠️ This Library Is AI-Generated and Experimental

RunePlot is being designed and developed with heavy assistance from AI tools.
The project is in **pre-alpha**, the API is unstable, and the implementation is not yet production-ready.
Use at your own risk and expect frequent breaking changes.

RunePlot is an Elixir-native charting library focused on server-side rendering and framework-agnostic SVG output.

The long-term goal is to provide a clean, declarative API for building time-series and financial charts directly in Elixir, with zero JavaScript required. RunePlot draws inspiration from tools like TradingView Lightweight Charts, Highcharts Stock, and D3, while remaining small, composable, and easy to integrate into Phoenix, LiveView, Livebook, or any other Elixir application.

# ⚠️ This is **pre-alpha software**.

I am actively designing the architecture, API, series model, and rendering pipeline.
There is no stable API yet, and nothing is published on Hex.

**This is a placeholder release (v0.0.1).**

## Inspirations

Better libraries that you should probably consider using before picking this one:

* [Contex](https://contex-charts.org/)
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) 
* [Highcharts / Highcharts Stock](https://www.highcharts.com/) 
* [TradingView Lightweight Charts](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts) 

RunePlot draws ideas from all of them, but only hopes to someday be as useful as these projects.
